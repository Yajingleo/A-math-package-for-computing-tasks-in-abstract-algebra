# Chain-complex-mod-2

Here is a C++ code to compute the homology of chain complexes with Z/2 grading over Z/2. This algorithm is based on 
a cancellation lemma which is special to Z/2 coefficient. The time complexity is linear, which is very efficient compared with 
method using solving linear equations.
